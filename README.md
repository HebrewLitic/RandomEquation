# RandomEquation

Project:

Write a program that generate two random numbers, randomly assign an operator that adds, subtracts, divides, or multiplies the two numbers. The program must generate an output saying whether to "multiply, divide, subtract, or add" the two numbers. The user must input the correct answer to the operation. If the user inputs the correct answer, you will move on to the next question. If the user inputs the wrong answer, you will be given the correct answer, and the program will close.

Things I need:

come up with two random numbers.
assign a random operator to the two numbers.
calculate the correct answer to the operation.
ask the user the question
read input from the user.
determine if answer is correct
if answer is correct --> move onto next question
if answer is incorrect --> output correct answer, stop the program.
imports needed: java.lang.Math, java.util.Scanner, java.util.Random
